**Sentia Turbo** is a full-stack monorepo showcasing a sophisticated, tool-enabled AI agent for the Web3 space. It's more than just a chatbot; it's an interactive assistant that can understand user intent, fetch real-time financial data, and generate transactions that users can sign and execute directly from the chat interface.

The backend also features autonomous AI agents that run on a schedule to fetch, analyze, and summarize the latest news, financial, and DeFi data, providing users with timely, AI-generated insights on dedicated dashboards.

### 🌟 Core Features

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤖 **Tool-Enabled AI Agent** | A conversational chat interface where the AI can use custom tools to perform actions, such as fetching a user's wallet balance or generating transaction data.                                                    |
| 💳 **Inline Transaction UI** | A novel feature where the AI's intent to perform a transaction is rendered as an interactive UI component (`<TransactionCard />`) directly in the chat, powered by a custom `<tx>` tag protocol.                   |
| 🔒 **Web3 Authentication** | Secure wallet-based authentication using [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/) and SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum), integrated with a tRPC backend.                                                                  |
| 📊 **AI-Powered Dashboards** | Dedicated dashboards for Finance, DeFi, and News, populated with data and insights generated by autonomous, scheduled AI agents.                                                                                |
| 🕒 **Scheduled AI Summaries** | Backend cron jobs periodically fetch data from sources like DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, and CoinDesk, use an LLM to create insightful summaries, and store them in the database for the frontend to display.             |
| 🚀 **Modern Monorepo Stack** | Built with Turborepo, Bun, React, Vite, Hono, and tRPC for a fully type-safe, high-performance developer experience.                                                                                            |

### 🎬 Demo

Imagine asking your AI assistant to make a payment. Sentia understands your request, generates the transaction, and presents it to you for approval, right in the chat.

*(Placeholder for a GIF demonstrating the inline transaction card flow: User types "Send 0.1 ETH to vitalik.eth" -> AI responds with text and a TransactionCard -> User clicks "Sign Transaction" and confirms in their wallet.)*

### ⚙️ How It Works

Sentia's power comes from two primary flows: the interactive user-to-AI pipeline and the autonomous backend agent pipeline.

#### 1. Interactive Transaction Flow

This flow demonstrates how Sentia turns natural language into on-chain actions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend (React)
    participant Backend (Hono/tRPC)
    participant AI (OpenRouter)

    User->>Frontend: "Send 0.1 ETH to vitalik.eth"
    Frontend->>Backend: Calls `prompt` tRPC mutation with message
    Backend->>AI: Forwards prompt with system instructions and tools
    Note over AI: AI detects intent to "send" and uses the `transfer` tool.
    AI-->>Backend: Returns text response with a special `<tx>{...}</tx>` XML tag containing transaction JSON.
    Backend-->>Frontend: Returns the AI-generated string.
    Note over Frontend: The `InlineRouter` component parses the string.
    Frontend->>Frontend: Renders the text and a `<TransactionCard />` from the `<tx>` tag data.
    User->>Frontend: Clicks "Sign Transaction" on the card.
    Note over Frontend: The card uses `wagmi` hooks to initiate the transaction.
    Frontend->>User: Wallet (e.g., MetaMask) prompts for signature.
    User->>Frontend: Signs transaction.
    Frontend->>Blockchain: Submits the signed transaction.
